# Final touches
* Only allow network traffic from load balancer
* Remove external IP from instance template
* Only allow SSH from management subnet
* Only allow webservers to talk through a NAT gateway


When you are done, you can feel satisfied :)

If you still have time left and want to play around some more, there are some [extra tasks](../).
